#Project: Updating a Spreadsheet
In this project, you’ll write a program to update cells in a spreadsheet of produce sales. Your program will look through the spreadsheet, find specific kinds of produce, and update their prices.

Your program does the following:
1. Loops over all the rows
2. If the row is for garlic, celery, or lemons, changes the price

This means your code will need to do the following:
1. Open the spreadsheet file.
2. For each row, check whether the value in column A is Celery, Garlic, or Lemon.
3. If it is, update the price in column B.
Save the spreadsheet to a new file (so that you don’t lose the old spreadsheet, just in case).
